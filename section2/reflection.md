# Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
##*  Reflecting resonated with me because I big portion on growing is coming across problems and then realizing what works and what doesn't. More importantly is being able to retrieve that information later on when you come across another problem whether it is similar or different.
##*  I feel like the first goes hand in hand with understanding that mistakes are inevitable and allow you to learn and grow. This in combination with reflecting on what you learned from your mistake (or perhaps the process itself of overcoming that obstacle) is a very helpful tool at being successful in this field.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
##* I feel like I already keep mental notes when I come across an issue that I later find the answer to. I also have started to realize when stuck on an issue it is best to take a break and come back and sometimes having a clean mind can help you address the issue. I did this once and after the first time I know do this everytime I come across a problem that is taking a while to figure out.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
##* A condition statement is a statment that you use using if this statement alows your code to run if the statement is true or to proceed to the next condition. For example: ```if I am hungry
                I will eat
            else
                I will not eat```                                                                                                                                 or to be more specific ``` are_you_hungry = no
  if are are_you_hungry == no
    put "Ok, you're not hungry"
  else
    put "What would you like to eat?"
  end  ```                                                                              or ``` money = 2
  if money >= 2
    put "I can buy chips"
  else
    put "Can not buy chips"
  end```



4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
##* You may want to use an if-statment if you want to have multiple condition (and/or) multiple outcomes or outputs from those condition(s)

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
##* the ruby syntax for and if statement is using if then the (condition) then bellow tabing the outcome(s) to that statmente. You can include elsif or else after to add addition conditions. The if statment is ended with the word 'end'.

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
##*  You can use elsif to add multple conditions to a if statement.

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
##*  ``` money = 2
if money = 2
  put "I can buy chips"
elsif money >= 2
  puts "You can buy chips and drink"
else
  put "Can not buy chips"
end```
